You are also able to see the directions and recipe for a drink you want! Rate this drink from 1-5 stars so others who visit the app will now how tasty it was.

## Setup
1. Fork this repo - on the top right corner of this page, click the **Fork** button. 
2. Clone down the forked repo. To rename your project you can use an optional argument when you run git clone (you replace the [...] with the terminal command arguments): `git clone [remote-address] [what you want to name the repo]`
3. Once you have cloned the repo, change into the directory and install the project dependencies. Run `npm install` to install project dependencies.
4. Run `npm start` in the terminal to see the page running in your browser on `http://localhost:3000/`. `Control + C` is the command to stop running the local server.  Closing the terminal without stopping the server first could allow the server to continue to run in the background and cause problems. This command is not specific to Webpack; make note of it for future use. 
7. Enjoy!

## Future Additions
- Adding a form that allows user to add recipes/drinks.
- Allowing user to favorite drinks

## Technologies
